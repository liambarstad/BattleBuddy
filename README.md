# BattleBuddy

## Premise
  
  An alarm application that allows users to look up a location in Google Maps and save it to the alarm. When the alarm is active, it checks the traffic and weather conditions with a logarithmically increasing frequency. If the ETA exceeds the time of the initial (or average) trip, the alarm is set back to make up the difference and get the user where they need to go on time. Other features include the ability to set an itinerary, with items pertaining to preparation steps. A user can then snooze through each itinerary item instead of a set time.
